# Request-for-school-documents

This web application that is made using `Laravel`, `Bootstrap` and `jQuery`, aims to enable students to request one or more of the four available school documents for a specific purpose. 
Additionally, it offers students the opportunity to submit a complaint if necessary. 
The application validates all the information provided by students while filling out the form before definitively validating its submission for further administrative processing.
